# Laravel Cashier - Mollie Edition (Alpha)

## Introduction
Laravel Cashier provides an expressive, fluent interface to Mollie's subscription billing services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle coupons, swapping subscription, cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.

## Documentation
Since this is an unofficial Laravel package, you can not find any documentation about this package on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/billing).
